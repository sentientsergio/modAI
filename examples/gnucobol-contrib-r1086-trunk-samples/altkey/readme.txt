 altkey * Alternate Key demo.

    This program demonstrates how alternate keys are used.  It is
 intended for students who would like to learn how to use alternate
 keys.

    The program creates an indexed file and writes sample records to
 it.

    It then issues a START command on the alternate key.  This causes
 all read next commands to read the file using the alternate key
 instead of the primary key.

    After each read through the alternate keys, one of the alternate
 keys is blanked out or deleted and the read loop run again.  This is
 repeated until there are no more alternate keys.

    The program displays each file operation on the screen.  The left
 column shows the operation, including the file status code.  The
 right column shows the record, with the primary key followed by the
 alternate key.

    Blank alternate keys do not appear in the read loop because of the
 'suppress when spaces' clause.  As an exercise, recompile with
 -DNOSUPPRESS or comment out the clause and see the difference when
 the program is run again.

    To compile and run under GnuCOBOL with 2.2+ on all systems:

cobc -xj altkey.cob

    To compile and run under older GnuCOBOL versions on Linux/Cygwin/MSYS:

cobc -x altkey.cob
./altkey

    To compile and run under older GnuCOBOL on MS Windows CMD:

cobc -x altkey.cob
.\altkey.exe

    If "suppress when space" is not supported, use GnuCOBOL 3.0+
 and compile it again.  Or run the program without it (see notes above).
