CGI file upload demo.

HTML forms without file upload have a content-type 
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Processing this content type is
usually simply. 

But if you want to upload a file, then you have to process the 
content-type "multipart/form-data". This program demonstrates how a file
upload is processed. 

The program usage is described in the program header.
