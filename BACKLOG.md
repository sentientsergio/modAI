## Epic 4: Application Refactoring Agent

### Description

Develop an agent that uses the target architecture YAML and the translated code to draft refactorings that align with the target architecture blueprint.

#### User Stories

- **Story 4.1:** As a developer, I want to create an application refactoring agent that can read target architecture YAML and translated code to identify refactoring opportunities.
- **Story 4.2:** As a developer, I want to implement refactoring strategies that include creating REST APIs, cloud data services, and object-oriented file services.
- **Story 4.3:** As a user, I want to test the application refactoring agent with various target architecture YAML and translated code samples to verify its effectiveness.
- **Story 4.4:** As a developer, I want to create documentation and guidelines for using the application refactoring agent to ensure successful refactorings by other team members.

## Epic 5: Code Translation Agents

### Description

Develop agents capable of translating the intermediate representation YAML into modern programming languages such as Java, C#, or Python.

#### User Stories

- **Story 5.1:** As a developer, I want to create a translation agent for Java that can convert SIR YAML into syntactically correct Java code.
- **Story 5.2:** As a developer, I want to create a translation agent for C# that can convert SIR YAML into syntactically correct C# code.
- **Story 5.3:** As a developer, I want to create a translation agent for Python that can convert SIR YAML into syntactically correct Python code.
- **Story 5.4:** As a user, I want to test the translation agents with various SIR YAML samples to verify the accuracy and functionality of the generated code.

## Epic 6: Integration and Testing

### Description

Ensure seamless integration and comprehensive testing of all components of modAI.

#### User Stories

- **Story 6.1:** As a developer, I want to integrate the semantic analysis agent, translation agents, and refactoring agent into a cohesive system.
- **Story 6.2:** As a tester, I want to develop automated tests to verify the functionality and accuracy of each component in isolation.
- **Story 6.3:** As a tester, I want to develop end-to-end tests to ensure the entire modAI workflow operates correctly from legacy code analysis to modernized code deployment.
- **Story 6.4:** As a user, I want to conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with real-world legacy code samples to validate the practical utility of modAI.

## Epic 7: Documentation and Training

### Description

Provide comprehensive documentation and training materials for users and developers of modAI.

#### User Stories

- **Story 7.1:** As a technical writer, I want to create detailed user manuals and API documentation for each component of modAI.
