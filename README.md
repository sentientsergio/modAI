![modAI Logo](./images/modai.png)

### Introduction

#### ModernizeAI (modAI)

#### Description

ModernizeAI (modAI) is an agentic generative AI solution designed to support the reengineering of legacy applications implemented in dead languages like COBOL and Assembly Language. The core components of modAI include semantic analysis agents, intermediate representation YAML, code translation agents, target architecture YAML, and application refactoring agents.

1. **Semantic Analysis Agent**: Reads legacy code and writes a language-independent semantic intermediate representation in YAML.
2. **Intermediate Representation YAML**: Encodes the programming language-independent semantics of the analyzed legacy code in a structured, machine-readable format.
3. **Code Translation Agents**: Translate the intermediate representation YAML into modern programming languages such as Java, C#, and Python.
4. **Target Architecture YAML**: Defines the target architecture for containerizing and deploying the code in the target environment.
5. **Application Refactoring Agent**: Uses the target architecture and the bodies of translated code to draft refactorings that align with the target architecture blueprint, including creating REST APIs, cloud data services, and object-oriented file services.

#### Inspiration

The transformative potential of generative AI technology and the urgent need to support the Federal Government and Financial Services organizations drive the creation of modAI. These entities face enormous technical debt due to mainframe computing running workloads with dead programming languages. The skills to maintain and develop these legacy platforms are rapidly vanishing, creating significant risks. modAI aims to help these organizations modernize their platforms, transitioning to cloud computing and reducing their reliance on outdated technologies.

### Problem Statement

ModernizeAI (modAI) addresses several critical challenges faced by organizations reliant on legacy systems:

1. **Understanding Undocumented Legacy Code**: Legacy applications, often written in COBOL and Assembly Language, typically lack comprehensive documentation. This makes it difficult for current engineers to understand and maintain these systems.
2. **Documenting Requirements**: Accurately documenting the requirements of these legacy systems is crucial for any modernization effort. Without proper documentation, translating and refactoring code becomes highly error-prone.
3. **Generating Translated Code Fragments**: Converting legacy code into modern programming languages is essential for integrating these systems with current technologies and platforms.
4. **Refactoring Translated Code**: Once translated, the code needs to be refactored into modern programmatic structures, such as REST APIs, and aligned with a target architecture to ensure it meets contemporary standards and can be efficiently maintained and extended.

#### Significance of These Challenges

The Federal Government and many Financial Services firms rely heavily on antiquated mainframe-based systems to accomplish core recordkeeping. These systems run large monolithic applications written in COBOL and Assembly Language. These organizations are legitimately concerned about their reliance on a dwindling pool of individuals who possess the knowledge to maintain and develop these legacy platforms.

#### Consequences of Inaction

Failure to address these challenges will result in only partial success in modernizing these platforms. Organizations will remain bound to supporting these legacy systems, significantly impacting their ability to be agile in adapting to changing legislation and business requirements. Moreover, the risk of running out of talent to maintain these systems is critical, potentially leading to severe operational disruptions.

### Objectives

#### Primary Goal

The primary goal of ModernizeAI (modAI) is to leverage a modern agentic generative AI solution to support the reengineering of monolithic legacy applications. While modAI incorporates advanced AI technologies, it also recognizes the essential role of human engineers. These engineers will benefit from the immense analytic support provided by modAI in generating requirements drafts, translating requirements, and refactoring translated code into a target architecture engineered in modern languages. This process leverages modern REST APIs to align with hosting in contemporary cloud service providers.

#### Secondary Goals

1. **Accuracy and Usefulness**: Addressing the inherent challenges of LLM-based engineering, modAI aims to produce accurate and optimally useful artifacts throughout the reengineering process. This involves automating critical review and testing of agent work products to maximize their accuracy and minimize the risks of model hallucination.
2. **Continuous Improvement**: As modAI evolves, it will continually enhance its capabilities to better support engineers in the reengineering process, ensuring the solutions remain relevant and effective.

#### Alignment with Challenges

These objectives directly address the challenges outlined in the problem statement by providing a robust solution for understanding and documenting legacy code, generating translated code fragments, and refactoring them into modern architectures. By doing so, modAI mitigates the risks associated with maintaining and developing legacy platforms, helping organizations transition to modern, agile, and maintainable systems.

### Features

#### Core Features of modAI

1. **Semantic Analysis Agent**
   - **Function**: Reads legacy code and writes a semantic intermediate representation in YAML.
   - **Implementation**: There will be a specific agent for each source language (e.g., COBOL, Assembly Language).
2. **Intermediate Representation YAML**
   - **Function**: Represents the semantics of the analyzed legacy code in a structured and machine-readable format.
3. **Code Translation Agents**
   - **Function**: Reads the intermediate representation YAML and implements it in a modern programming language.
   - **Implementation**: There will be a specific agent for each target language (e.g., Java, C#, Python).
4. **Target Architecture YAML**
   - **Function**: Serves as input to the refactoring agent, defining the target architecture for containerizing and deploying the code in the target environment.
5. **Application Refactoring Agent**
   - **Function**: Uses the target architecture and the bodies of translated code to draft refactorings that honor the target architecture blueprint. This includes creating REST APIs, cloud data services, and object-oriented file services.

#### Innovation and Uniqueness

The entire approach of modAI is innovative and unique. By combining semantic analysis, intermediate representations, and specialized translation and refactoring agents, modAI offers a comprehensive solution for reengineering legacy applications. This method ensures a seamless transition from outdated monolithic systems to modern, agile, and maintainable architectures.

#### Contribution to Objectives

These features directly contribute to achieving modAI's objectives by:

- Providing robust tools for understanding and documenting legacy code.
- Enabling accurate and efficient translation of legacy code into modern programming languages.
- Facilitating the refactoring of translated code into modern architectures, ensuring alignment with contemporary cloud service environments.

### Usage

#### Basic Usage

1. **Running the Semantic Analysis Agent**

   - **Purpose**: To read legacy code and generate a semantic intermediate representation in YAML.
   - **Example**:
     ```sh
     python semantic_analysis_agent.py --input legacy_code.cobol --output intermediate_representation.yaml
     ```

2. **Generating Code with Translation Agents**

   - **Purpose**: To translate the intermediate representation YAML into a modern programming language.
   - **Example**:
     ```sh
     python code_translation_agent.py --input intermediate_representation.yaml --language java --output translated_code.java
     ```

3. **Defining Target Architecture**

   - **Example**:
     ```yaml
     # target_architecture.yaml

       services:
         - name: user_service
           type: REST API
           endpoints:
